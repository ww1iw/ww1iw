In return, the Central Powers will recognize the Romanian union with the formerly Russian region of Bessarabia."

 brest_litovsk.13.t:0 "Polish Border Strip"
 brest_litovsk.13.d:0 "With Poland secured as a German puppet state, we can now settle the debate among the German General Staff, regarding the Polish Border Strip. An area comprising of up to 30,000 square kilometers and resting along the border of Poland and Germany, some want to annex the territory and settle it with German peoples, while others have said we should just leave it in the hands of Poland. Annexing the territory would be beneficial in many ways, however it would cause resentment among our Polish population and from the Polish government in Warsaw."
 brest_litovsk.13.a:0 "Annex it to the Reich"

 brest_litovsk.14.t:0 "Request Eastern Galicia"
 brest_litovsk.14.d:0 "Now that we have an alliance with the Central Powers, we are in a position to ask the neighboring state of Austria-Hungary to give us a part of Eastern Galicia which holds a considerable Ukrainian population and includes the populous city of Lvov. The Austro-Hungarians may accept in return for some of our crop yields, and we could open negotiations to see if they would be willing to give us the region"
 brest_litovsk.14.a:0 "Ask Austria-Hungary"
 brest_litovsk.15.t:0 "Give Lemburg to Ukraine?"
 brest_litovsk.15.d:0 "The Ukrainian government has asked us to cecede some parts of Eastern Galicia that hold a strong Ukrainian population. In doing so, we could gain some of Ukraine's crop yields and additionally calm some of the strong nationalist sentiment in Austria-Hungary that has threatened to collapse our nation from the inside. On the downside, agreeing would make us hand over a considerable region, including the important city of Lemburg.
 brest_litovsk.15.a:0 "Make the deal"

 brest_litovsk.16.d:0 "With the Russian Tsarist government toppled, the Bolsheviks in power, and the Russian Civil War raging on, the Central Powers and the Russian SFSR have agreed to a ceasefire in order to negotiate a withdrawal of Russia from the Great War. It is hard to say if negotiations will succeed, but the Bolsheviks can surely not afford to keep up the war against the Central Powers and the various White Russian factions that have spawned throughout the former Russian Empire."

But now they have declared independence as part of a goal to create an independent state in the Caucasus mountains, something which has not existed for centuries. We do not have the resources to deal with them right now admist our other conflicts, but we have no doubt that this insurrection will end with nothing more then the Red Army flag held high above the Caucasus."

 caucasus.4.t:0 "A new Transcaucasian state?"
 caucasus.4.d:0 "A new Transcaucasian state has formed on our eastern border, and they have taken or claimed land that is rightful Ottoman territory, notably the region of Kars. We can exploit their apparent weakness to control Eastern Armenia, Batum, and other parts of the Caucasus, and gain access to the very important Baku oilfields, which could supply our armies and navy for decades to come. We could also leave them be and peacefully trade for their oil, but they could be cooperating with the Bolsheviks or the British, something we cannot tolerate if we are to gain any influence in the Caucasus."
 caucasus.4.a:0 "Those are our lands!"
 caucasus.4.b:0 "It's not worth it"
 caucasus.5.t:0 "Ceasefire to negotiate"
 caucasus.5.d:0 "After Ottoman forces have advanced through Eastern Anatolia to take Kars and Batum, our two governments have mutually agreed to temporarily end hostilities and discuss the terms of a peace treaty between the Ottoman Empire and the Transcaucasian Federation."

 caucasus.6.t:0 "Send our demands"
 caucasus.6.d:0 "With a ceasefire in place on the Caucasus front, we can send our demands to the Transcaucasian Federation. There are two main posibilities as to how we can proceed. First, we could just keep what we have gained so far, and end our war. The Transcaucasian delegation would be likely to accept, and this would formally end one of our fronts, allowing us to focus entirely on the British threat in the Middle East. Alternatively, we could expand our demands to include parts of Eastern Armenia and the major city of Tiflis, which would give us a lot more power in the Caucasus, but in all likelihood would renew hostilities."
 caucasus.6.a:0 "Keep our current gains"
 caucasus.6.b:0 "Extend our demands"
 caucasus.7.t:0 "Ottomans send terms"
 caucasus.7.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire has sent us their demands, and they seem to be very satisfactory. The Turks have agreed to not try to take any more of our territory if we simply respect our current mutual borders. We would still stay in control of almost all of Transcaucasia and more importantly our federation is likely to stay intact for the near future."
 caucasus.7.a:0 "We can agree to these terms"
 caucasus.8.t:0 "Ottomans send terms"
 caucasus.8.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire has sent us their demands, and they have chosen to expand their previous ambitions. The Turks have demanded that we hand over a significant portion of Eastern Armenia and the city of Tiflis, which is our capital in Georgia. If we agree to these terms, the Georgians will not be happy, and it could lead to further conflict. But even if we refuse, it is hard to say if we will be able to hold off the Ottoman armies, even with our mountainous terrain."

 caucasus.9.t:0 "Georgia declares independence"
 caucasus.9.d:0 "After encouragement by the Germans and the unfortunate outcome of our negotiations with the Ottomans, Georgia has declared its independence as an independent Democratic Republic of Georgia. This does not bode well for our federation, and it is very likely that soon the Transcaucasian Federation will cease to exist. We could attempt to pacify them, but unless we can do it quickly it may prove to be a fruitless effort."

 caucasus.10.t:0 "Transcausian Federation breaks down"
 caucasus.10.d:0 "As a subsequent result of the Georgian declaration of independence two days earlier, our predictions have come true and the Transcaucasian Federation has broken down, with two separate republics also declaring independence, being the Democratic Republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. This will most likely result in a power struggle, both among the Caucasian republics and foreign powers vying for influence."
 caucasus.10.a:0 "The federation is over"
 caucasus.11.t:0 "German influence in the Caucasus"
 caucasus.11.d:0 "The newly formed Georgian nation is in a precarious situation, and it has given us an opportunity to expand our influence to the Caucasus region. A growing rivalry has been developing between us and the Ottomans over control of the Caucasus, specifically the Baku oilfields. If we align ourselves with Georgia and make the Ottomans end their war with them, we could secure a lasting foothold and ally in the vital region."

 caucasus.12.t:0 "Ottoman influence in the Caucasus"
 caucasus.12.d:0 "Now that the Transcausasian Federation has developed into three independent states, we can take this opportunity to expand our influence in the region. One of the new countries, Azerbaijan, is a Muslim state, and like us, is hostile to the Armenians. They also control the Baku oil fields, and if we align with them we can coordinate against Armenia, secure the oilfields, and create an alliance in the region."

 caucasus.13.t:0 "British influence in the Caucasus"
 caucasus.13.d:0 "An independent Armenian state has formed in the Caucasus, and it may give us an opportunity to form an alliance against the Ottomans in the region. Ever since the start of the war, Armenian soldiers have fought with the Russian Empire against the Ottoman Turks, and we can now align with them. The Armenians have ambitions in Eastern Anatolia which could be put to use when the Turks are defeated. We also need to secure the Caucasus from the threat of both the Germans and the Bolsheviks"

 caucasus.13.b:0 "We have other plans"
 caucasus.14.t:0 "Treaty of Poti"
 caucasus.14.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Georgia and the German Empire have signed a treaty in Poti, Georgia, acknowledging an alliance between the two countries and a German protectorate over Georgia. This will expand German influence in the region, and will most likely force the Ottomans to abandon their war with Georgia."

 caucasus.15.t:0 "End war with Georgia?"
 caucasus.15.d:0 "Since the signing of the Treaty of Poti, the Germans have asked us to halt our advance against Georgia and immediately cease hostilities. If we refuse, they have threatened to stop all German military and diplomatic support. We cannot likely afford these consequences and the loss of Germany as an ally, and we still have control of the Baku oilfields from Azerbaijan. Should we accept the German terms?"

 caucasus.16.t:0 "Ask Ottomans for peace"
 caucasus.16.d:0 "Armenia is a country virtually besieged on all fronts by the Ottoman Empire in the west and Azerbaijan in the east. If we make peace with the Ottomans, we may lose some territory, but we will ultimately survive as a nation."
