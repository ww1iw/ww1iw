 LOADING_TIP_10:0 "Yet when we achieved, and the new world dawned, the old men came out again and took our victory to remake it in the likeness of the former world they knew.

 LOADING_TIP_17:0 "Don't believe stories which you see in the papers about troops asking as a special privilege not to be relieved.

 LOADING_TIP_18:0 "So great are the psychological restistances to war in modern nations, that every war must appear to be a war of defence against a menacing, murderous aggressor.

 LOADING_TIP_26:0 "Something was brought near the reserve trench, camouflaged with a big sheet. We didn't know what it was and were very curious and the Captain got us all out on parade.

 LOADING_TIP_27:0 "He told us what we had to do when we made the attack at Zero Hour was just to wait for the tank to go by us and all we had to do was mop up, consolidate our trench.

The old world never recovered from the shock.\n- Edmund Taylor"
 LOADING_TIP_58:0 "The trench experience was one of the most sustained and systematic shattering of the human senses: it stripped man of the protective layers of civilisation and thrust his naked, fragile body between the ravages of industrial modernity, on the one hand, and the chaos of formless matter on the other.\n- Tim Kendall"

 LOADING_TIP_81:0 "There is scarcely a town or school in Russia from which boys have not run away to the war.

 LOADING_TIP_82:0 "I shall not easily forget those long winter nights in the front line. Darkness fell about four in the afternoon and dawn was not until eight next morning.

They cried for mercy, but I had my orders.\n- Private A.H. Hubbard"

A man in the rear shouted angrily: 'You're a bloody butcher'. He rode off taking no notice, but after that he became known in the 5th Army as 'Butcher Gough'.\n- Captain A. F. P. Christison, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, August 1917"
